* Yet another short introduction to R with some emphasis on meta-analysis

- data :: Raudenbush's (1984) "Teacher expectancy data" as SPSS file (dTeachExpRed.sav).
- graphs :: R plots and screen shots.
- report :: The presentation slides as PDF and org-mode file.
- src :: Tangled R code. Note, that R files ending with "_nonorg.R" are more "human-readable".
